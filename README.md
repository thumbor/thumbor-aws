## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
pip install thumbor-aws
```
## üéØ Features

- Asynchronous non-blocking AWS S3 support
- Conforms with thumbor 7 new storage and results storage specs
- Python 3 compliant
- S3 Storage - Load source files from S3
- S3 Storage - Retrieve and store source files, detector data and security keys
- S3 Result Storage - Retrieve and store resulting images
- Compatibility mode for users of tc_aws: currently supported loader, storage and result storage

## Usage

### Configuring thumbor

Configure your `thumbor.conf` file to point to `thumbor_aws`:

```
## The loader thumbor should use to find source images.
## This must be the full name of a python module (python must be able to import it)
LOADER = "thumbor.loaders.http_loader"

## The file storage thumbor should use to store original images.
## This must be the full name of a python module (python must be able to import it)
STORAGE = 'thumbor_aws.storage'

## The result storage thumbor should use to store generated images.
## This must be the full name of a python module (python must be able to import it)
RESULT_STORAGE = 'thumbor_aws.result_storage'
```

You should use only the extensions required by your use case.
There's no dependency between them.

### Configuration

thumbor-aws allows you to configure each extension independently:

#### General

Some S3 providers fail to return a valid location header when uploading a new object. For that scenario, `thumbor-aws` allows users to set the location template to be used.

```
## Default location to use if S3 does not return location header.
## Can use {bucket_name} var.
## Defaults to: 'https://{bucket_name}.s3.amazonaws.com'
AWS_DEFAULT_LOCATION = "https://{bucket_name}.s3.amazonaws.com"
```

#### Loader

thumbor-aws loader offer several configuration options:

```python
################################## AWS Loader ##################################

## Region where thumbor's objects are going to be loaded from.
## Defaults to: 'us-east-1'
#AWS_LOADER_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'

## S3 Bucket where thumbor's objects are loaded from.
## Defaults to: 'thumbor'
#AWS_LOADER_BUCKET_NAME = 'thumbor'

## Secret access key for S3 Loader.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_LOADER_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = None

## Access key ID for S3 Loader.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_LOADER_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = None

## Endpoint URL for S3 API. Very useful for testing.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_LOADER_S3_ENDPOINT_URL = None

## Loader prefix path.
## Defaults to: '/st'
#AWS_LOADER_ROOT_PATH = '/st'

```

#### Storage

Below you can see the result of running thumbor's config generation after importing thumbor-aws:

```
################################# AWS Storage ##################################

## Region where thumbor's objects are going to be stored.
## Defaults to: 'us-east-1'
#AWS_STORAGE_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'

## S3 Bucket where thumbor's objects are going to be stored.
## Defaults to: 'thumbor'
#AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'thumbor'

## Secret access key for S3 to allow thumbor to store objects there.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = None

## Access key ID for S3 to allow thumbor to store objects there.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = None

## Endpoint URL for S3 API. Very useful for testing.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT_URL = None

## Storage prefix path.
## Defaults to: '/st'
#AWS_STORAGE_ROOT_PATH = '/st'

## Storage ACL for files written in bucket
## Defaults to: 'public-read'
#AWS_STORAGE_S3_ACL = 'public-read'

## Default location to use if S3 does not return location header. Can use
## {bucket_name} var.
## Defaults to: 'https://{bucket_name}.s3.amazonaws.com'
#AWS_DEFAULT_LOCATION = 'https://{bucket_name}.s3.amazonaws.com'

```

#### Result Storage

Below you can see the result of running thumbor's config generation after importing thumbor-aws:

```
############################## AWS Result Storage ##############################

## Region where thumbor's objects are going to be stored.
## Defaults to: 'us-east-1'
#AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'

## S3 Bucket where thumbor's objects are going to be stored.
## Defaults to: 'thumbor'
#AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'thumbor'

## Secret access key for S3 to allow thumbor to store objects there.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = None

## Access key ID for S3 to allow thumbor to store objects there.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = None

## Endpoint URL for S3 API. Very useful for testing.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT_URL = None

## Result Storage prefix path.
## Defaults to: '/rs'
#AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_ROOT_PATH = '/rs'

## ACL to use for storing items in S3.
## Defaults to: None
#AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_S3_ACL = None

### Configuring thumbor in compatibility mode with tc_aws

If you are a [tc_aws](https://github.com/thumbor-community/aws) user, thumbor-aws has a compatibility mode where you can use the same configuration you are already used to:

```python
############################# tc_aws Compatibility #############################

## Runs in compatibility mode using the configurations for tc_aws.
## Defaults to: False
THUMBOR_AWS_RUN_IN_COMPATIBILITY_MODE = True

## AWS Region the bucket is located in.
## Defaults to: 'us-east-1'
TC_AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1'

## Max retries for get image from S3 Bucket. Default is 0
## Defaults to: 0
TC_AWS_MAX_RETRY = 0  # This is not yet supported

## S3 bucket for Loader. If given, source urls are interpreted as keys within
## this bucket. If not given, source urls are expected to containthe bucket
## name, such as 's3-bucket/keypath'.
## Defaults to: ''
TC_AWS_LOADER_BUCKET = 'my-bucket'

## S3 path prefix for Loader bucket. If given, this is prefixed to all S3 keys.
## Defaults to: ''
TC_AWS_LOADER_ROOT_PATH = 'source-files'

## S3 bucket for Storage
## Defaults to: ''
TC_AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET = 'my-bucket'

## S3 path prefix for Storage bucket
## Defaults to: ''
TC_AWS_STORAGE_ROOT_PATH = 'source-files'

## put data into S3 using the Server Side Encryption functionality to encrypt
## data at rest in S3 https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-
## new/2011/10/04/amazon-s3-announces-server-side-encryption-support/
## Defaults to: False
TC_AWS_STORAGE_SSE = False  # This is not yet supported

## put data into S3 with Reduced Redundancy https://aws.amazon.com/about-
## aws/whats-new/2010/05/19/announcing-amazon-s3-reduced-redundancy-storage/
## Defaults to: False
TC_AWS_STORAGE_RRS = False  # This is not yet supported

## S3 bucket for result Storage
## Defaults to: ''
TC_AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_BUCKET = 'my-bucket'

## S3 path prefix for Result storage bucket
## Defaults to: ''
TC_AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_ROOT_PATH = 'result-storage'

## Store result with metadata (for instance content-type)
## Defaults to: False
# This configuration won't matter as thumbor-aws stores metadata anyway
TC_AWS_STORE_METADATA = False

################################################################################
```

Please notice the addition of `THUMBOR_AWS_RUN_IN_COMPATIBILITY_MODE = True` to tell `thumbor_aws` you want compatibility with `tc_aws`.

If you have any issues with this

#### Caveats

1. thumbor-aws does not create buckets for you. If they don't exist you are getting errors.

You can easily create a bucket using [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/?nc1=h_ls) with:

```
$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <bucket name> --region <your region>
```

Or through your [AWS Console UI](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1).

### Troubles?

If you experience any troubles, try running:

```bash
