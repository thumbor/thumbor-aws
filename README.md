## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
pip install thumbor-aws
```

## Usage

### Configuring thumbor

Configure your `thumbor.conf` file to point to `thumbor_aws`:

```
## The file storage thumbor should use to store original images. This must be the
## full name of a python module (python must be able to import it)
## Defaults to: 'thumbor.storages.file_storage'
STORAGE = 'thumbor_aws.storage'

## The result storage thumbor should use to store generated images. This must be
## the full name of a python module (python must be able to import it)
## Defaults to: None
RESULT_STORAGE = 'thumbor_aws.result_storage'
```

As usual for thumbor, you don't need to use both at the same time. Feel free to use only what's needed.

### Configuration

thumbor-aws allows you to configure each storage independently, so there are configuration keys for each.

#### Storage

Below you can see the result of running thumbor's config generation after importing thumbor-aws:

```
################################# AWS Storage ##################################

## Region where thumbor's objects are going to be stored.
## Defaults to: 'us-east-1'
# AWS_STORAGE_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'

## S3 Bucket where thumbor's objects are going to be stored.
## Defaults to: 'thumbor'
# AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'thumbor'

## Secret access key for S3 to allow thumbor to store objects there.
## Defaults to: None
# AWS_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = None

## Access key ID for S3 to allow thumbor to store objects there.
## Defaults to: None
# AWS_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = None

## Endpoint URL for S3 API. Very useful for testing.
## Defaults to: None
# AWS_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT_URL = None

## Endpoint URL for S3 API. Very useful for testing.
## Defaults to: None
# AWS_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT_URL = None

## Storage prefix path.
## Defaults to: '/st'
# AWS_STORAGE_ROOT_PATH = '/st'

## Storage ACL for files written in bucket
## Defaults to: 'public-read'
# AWS_STORAGE_S3_ACL = 'public-read'

################################################################################
```

#### Result Storage

Below you can see the result of running thumbor's config generation after importing thumbor-aws:

```
############################## AWS Result Storage ##############################

## Region where thumbor's objects are going to be stored.
## Defaults to: 'us-east-1'
# AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'

## S3 Bucket where thumbor's objects are going to be stored.
## Defaults to: 'thumbor'
# AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'thumbor'

## Secret access key for S3 to allow thumbor to store objects there.
## Defaults to: None
# AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = None

## Access key ID for S3 to allow thumbor to store objects there.
## Defaults to: None
# AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = None

## Endpoint URL for S3 API. Very useful for testing.
## Defaults to: None
# AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT_URL = None

## Result Storage prefix path.
## Defaults to: '/rs'
# AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_ROOT_PATH = '/rs'

## ACL to use for storing items in S3.
## Defaults to: None
# AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_S3_ACL = None

#### Caveats

1. thumbor-aws does not create buckets for you. If they don't exist you are getting errors.

You can easily create a bucket using [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/?nc1=h_ls) with:

```
$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <bucket name> --region <your region>
```

Or through your [AWS Console UI](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1).

### Troubles?

If you experience any troubles, try running:

```bash
thumbor-doctor
```
